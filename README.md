# Infection
A program using python to simulate herd immunity in a population
Population is represented by circles of different colours, green - supseptible , red - infected, blue - immune
1 Day is one infection cycle
Immunity can be lost over time
Note: Entire population kept in memory, keep an eye on the memory consumption of the program, if it becomes too slow you may need the 64 bit version of python and pygame
